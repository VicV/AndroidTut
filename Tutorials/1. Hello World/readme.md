#Hello World

###Workspace Setup and the easiest Hello World ever
=================================================

####The Setup
Alright, now that we're delving into writing some stuff, lets get your workspace sorted out.

Did you start Eclipse? Then you're off to a good start.

You should see something like this:

But, you should be doing this on a mac so you shouldn't see Windows stuff at all. Anyways, everything should work very nicely now.

Go to ` File > New > Android Application Project`

then you should see some silly popups. What the hell does all of that mean?

**Application Name**: Well, this is what your app is going to be called. Name it Hello World, or whatever, I don't care.

**Project Name**: Its just what the project in the workspace is called. Honestly just make it the same as the app name.

**Package Name**: This one is a bit weird. This is a very unique identifier for your application. If you go to any Google Play Store app and look at the URL, you'll see the identifier that that app used (such as: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snapchat.android). Notice Snapchat does com.snapchat.android -- so lets follow this convention of reverse domain. For me, in this project, my packagename will be com.vicvu.helloworld

**All the other stuff:** These are all extremely important. But right now? We do not care. Keep them as is.

**All the other pages:** Basically, just click next all the way through. Just notice things like setting the icon (which you can do later anyways), and that this is going to be **_Blank Activity_**. Just click next all the way through.

Okay, are you through yet? Because you should be. Now what do you see? It should be something like this:

But what the hell are we looking at? **That doesn't matter right now**. First, we need to get this baby to run.

###Running your App

So, if you've followed this far through and don't have an Android phone, you're in for a surprise. And by surprise I mean a world full of frustration and pain. You need to set up an emulator! How? Well, go find out on your own -- I'm not going to get into that for now. 

If you DO have an android phone however, you need to set it into dev mode and allow USB debugging!

How? Follow this: http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html
